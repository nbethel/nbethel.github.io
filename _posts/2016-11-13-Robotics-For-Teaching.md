I recently volunteered for the Science and Health Education Partnership (SEP). This program promotes partnerships between scientists and teachers to bring high quality science education to K-12 students. My responsibilities involved designing and teaching a series of lessons to the third grade class at Bret Hart Elementary School in San Francisco, California. I designed two of the lessons around the subject of robotics. I was actually surprised how difficult it was to obtain robots for educational purposes. After many phone calls, emails and general inquires, I found out that the San Francisco Public Library had robots for such use, and that a representative from the library would come to lead the lesson with me! The students were drawn to the robots that we used, and had the opportunity to build and program the robots themselves. I hope to have influenced some of the students to pursue science and engineering careers later in life.
